# Simple Android Web App

Is it possible that you need a web app to contain some websites? So, you can create an Android app just to provide a URL using this repository. Enjoy it.

## How to create

Replace url. The folder located in app>src>main>java>com>symcghost>g4_rexton.

```java
        mWebView.loadUrl("http://www.symcghost.com/mobile");
```

and build. That's all.

Plus, you would better use https instead of http for security issues.
